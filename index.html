<h2>Future of STL Rap</h2>
<p>As of late, music has reflected the environment of society. Saint Louis's rap scene is no different. It reflects the culture of Saint Louis, particlularly the inner city. The stories reflect the violent nature of the streets. Streets that are filled with hoplessness, poverty, and dispair. A place where dreams are 'sold' to eager buyers, who oftimes get scammed out of their freedsom, and sometimes their lives. In 2022, Amr Dee Huncho was a victim of such violence. He was shot several times while sitting in a vehicle. There were even reports that he had passed. Thankfully these rumors were false, and he bounced back. His music documents these occurences in his life. With this theme, let's wish for new levels for bro!</p>


<p>The future of Stl Rap is a bright one. With artists such as Amr Dee Hunch, the creativing and sound is steadily evolving.</p>
